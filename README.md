Live demo: https://martinsmeder.github.io/battleship/

A browser based game of battleship!

Some things I've learned:

- How to write unit tests
- How to write testable code
- What's important to test, and what's not important
- How to work with multiple factory functions
- How to attach multiple eventListeners to the same div with a single method

Some mistakes to avoid in the future:

- Working with with different coordinate units instead of the same throughout
  the entire program
- Rushing through the planning phase
- Over reliance on chat GPT (especially at the beginning) without making sure
  to understand all the code, this made debugging quite unpleasant later on
