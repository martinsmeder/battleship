// This module can be responsible for rendering content on the page.
// It can include functions to update the DOM elements representing the
// game boards, ships, attacks, messages, and other UI components. It should
// encapsulate the DOM manipulation code and provide a clean interface for
// updating the UI based on the game state. It can be the bridge between the
// game logic and the actual DOM manipulation.
